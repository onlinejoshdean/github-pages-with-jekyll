# Acts 10 Cornelius 

## Intro

Hubi dustan - hello friends


The news hangs heavy over us today. 

We are being asked to change our way of living once again. Interestingly it is reverting back to a way of doing things that we did for a few months before. 

Changing things is hard.  

There is another analogy that will help us in our thoughts today. 

There is a musician that I really liked, I listened to his music all the way through university. I told other about the albums I loved, I played his songs on my university radio station a lot. 

I downloaded unreleased leaked albums from websites where they were quietly but intentionally leaked. 

But then more recently, allegations of emotional abuse and destructive behaviours started to surface. 

And a newer songwriter I got into was writing songs about the abuse she suffered at his hands and it has done something to the old music for me. 

It is tainted and I need to leave it behind in some sense. 

I can’t go back. I have to in some sense give up on something that means a lot to me. Something that I really liked. 

 

Changing things you have done for a long time and things you like is hard.  Peter has to learn this (along with some other lessons). 


We must be sensitive to the issues with which Peter was struggling when he encountered Cornelius, because they are issues deeply rooted in the human experience. 

People sometimes like to isolate themselves from others. People find their identity within a group, and fear that they will lose that identity if they do not guard their separateness. People find it difficult to relate to and associate with those who are different from themselves. People have a sense that they will lose their status within their own group if they dare to reach out to those on the outside.

Doesn’t it sometimes just feel like God is doing a new thing?

Expand on this. 

What do we do then we are challenged on stuff that we have believed for years.


This is new and difficult 

Jews have had food laws for ages

Generations and the nation have been keeping the sabbath every week. 
It is part of who they are a people and who they all are as a person. 
Part of a group. 

Recognised by God
Recognised by their neighbours.

Peter in Acts 10 has to come to terms with the unlearning of his behaviour. He has to see that God sees things differently, maybe always has, he has to also let go of all the certainty and safety that the old way of doing things gave him. All that identity and all that social capital etc etc. 

It is a hard question to ask of oneself, is God moving in a different direction that the one I always thought was the right one? Doesn’t it sometimes just feel like God is doing a new thing?

In Acts 10 that seems to be the case. 

Cornelius Helps him learn this. 

Now God, Jesus, and Cornelius are needed to help Peter learn this new and difficult thing. 

	Gradually, very, very slowly, Luke thought the Book of Acts is going to take us to Rome itself. He wants us to be getting ready for the big leagues.

God responds to Cornelius’s prayers with a vision. 

In this light, the soldier is given marching orders to follow into salvation: “send men to Joppa” for a certain man who is staying in a particular house (vv. 5–6). 

Obedience to God’s bidding is the hallmark of readiness to receive God’s grace. Cornelius obeys God according to his own military conventions: He “called … a devout soldier from the ranks” whose experience is most like Cornelius’s.


Slide 9 -13

	References to the time of day are always theologically laden in this book: The pious Cornelius had a vision “one afternoon at about three o’clock” (v. 3; see also 3:1). This was a time of day set aside for religious observance among the faithful of Israel–in the middle of the afternoon for all to see. 

We see a “double vision” is employed in Acts to get two people both on God’s page. Before both Saul and Ananias had separate visions about the same future (see 9:11–12); and here again Cornelius and “a certain Simon who is called Peter” will also have visionary experiences of the same future– the future that God has in store. 
Cornelius has been faithful and trying his best - God recognises him even if Peter would not have. 


He has been praying and donating. He recognises the God that is over all and responds to him as best he can. What he does, even before baptism is recognised and seen. 

For all his religious devotion Cornelius is not yet fully there and still makes theological mistakes: “Cornelius, falling at Peter’s feet, worshiped him” (10:25). 

Peter’s role, however, is to proclaim salvation, not to dispense it. His response testifies to this subordinate role in Cornelius’s salvation: “Stand up; I am only a mortal” (10:26; cf. 14:14–15).

Cornelius still needs some changing, some guidance, some new thing to lead him closer to the God his is serving in his own way. 

And this is an important little point, there is still some work to be done, some good news to be shared. Cornelius is a good man, that much seems clear but Peter is still needed to come and do something, just as Cornelius is needed to do something for Peter. 

Why bother sending for Peter to come and tell him about Jesus? Why not just stay as he was? 

The reason Cornelius was a devout worshipper of Israel’s God was precisely that he was fed up with the normal Roman gods and eager to follow what seemed to him the real one. 

It is not the case, then, that God simply ‘accepts us as we are’, but rather he 'He invites us as we are' 

Responding to that invitation always involves the complete transformation which is acted out in repentance, forgiveness, baptism, and receiving the spirit.

Peter arrives on the scene and despite his previous reluctance to he says to Cornelius: the God whom you have worshipped from afar has done all this, as part of his global plan to set everything right at last; and, at every stage, Jesus is in the middle of it all! 

God has thus fulfilled the purposes for which he called Israel in the first place; and you, Cornelius, and everyone everywhere who believes this message, will receive a welcome at once, without more ado, into the family whose home has, written in shining letters above the door, the wonderful word “forgiven”.’


**Peter now stands before a Centurion and describes Crucifixion to him, even those on the Roman side can be saved by the work fo Jesus.**



there can be no barriers to baptism. All this is what is meant by the opening line of Peter’s speech, 'God shows no partiality = God has no favourites.’ 

It means that there are no ethnic, geographical, cultural or moral barriers any longer in the way of anyone and everyone being offered forgiveness and new life. 
Cornelius didn’t want God (or Peter) to tolerate him. He wanted to be welcomed, forgiven, healed, transformed. And he was.

And let us not forget, Peter goes on to relay the history of who Jesus was and what he taught and importantly what happened to him. He was taken and killed. He was crucified. 

And who is he telling this too? A centurion!!
He is telling a centurion about a crucifixion. 

Its like telling me about this cool new product called the iPhone. Like telling Sylvia Routledge about Wimbledon. 


This is an important distinction


When Peter did speak, he offered a new perspective on his relationship with Gentiles and on the promise of God to them manifest in Jesus Christ. He began by asserting that he had now come to a true understanding. 

It was not just a true idea that he had now developed about other people and how he should treat them; it was a true understanding about God and God’s relationship to persons. 

Repeatedly Peter asserted that no person is beyond the care and concern of God: “God shows no partiality.” “In every nation, anyone” can be “acceptable to him.” Jesus Christ “is Lord of all” (vv. 34–36). Jesus healed “all who were oppressed by the devil” (v. 38). The prophets testify that “everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name” (v. 43; italics in this paragraph added).


We can rejoice in this. 

We can be encouraged by this. 

God works in ways we don’t always understand. 

We can’t always see the reasoning behind things. We don’t always understand 'why' things work out the way they do. 

And that ultimately is the path of faith. 

We may be asked to change the things we have been doing. We may have to ask ourselves the questions that Peter would have had to ask - is God moving in a different direction that the one I always thought was the right one? Doesn’t it sometimes just feel like God is doing a new thing?


Peter is being challenged in a major way here, even though he would have seen Jesus heal those who were outside of Israel, even though Jesus stopped people sacrificing in the temple. 
Even though there was so much embedded throughout the OT about care for neighbour and Israels responsibility to the people who lived among them and around them. 

Peter still has to climb the mountain of understanding that gets him to the place where he can break bread with Gentiles. 

Let’s focus on one last image from Acts 10. It’s an amazing one, it is Peter resisting the heavenly voice, on the grounds that he knows better. 

13 A voice said to him, “Get up, Peter; kill and eat.” 
14 “No, Lord!” Peter said. “For I have never eaten anything impure and ritually unclean.” 
15 Again, a second time, the voice said to him, “What God has made clean, do not call impure.” 16 This happened three times, and suddenly the object was taken up into heaven. 


Eventually Peter understands. 

But this passage speaks to me. 

It really catches me out.

It is of course just like the two other excellent Peter moment. 

Matthew 16

Matthew 16:13–23 (CSB)

> 15 “But you,” he asked them, “who do you say that I am?” 
>
> 16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” 
>
> 17 Jesus responded, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah,, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven.

## HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION PREDICTED

> 21 From then on Jesus began to point out to his disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and be raised the third day. 22 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, “Oh no, Lord! This will never happen to you!” 
> 23 Jesus turned and told Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me because you’re not thinking about God’s concerns but human concerns.”


Peter goes from the golden boy to the wayward son in the space of half a page. But we have this recorded for us. 

John 13:8 as well, Peter says to Jesus, you shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, "if I do not wash you, you have no share with me".


And doesn’t it ring true?

Can’t it be that we both understand who Jesus is and the amazing plan God has for the world but then sometimes get things wrong and take the bad option. Opening the wrong doors and striding through them as if we know best. 

Its is a reminder of our own weaknesses and about our own in built in things that lead us, makes us go through the wrong doors, down the wrong paths. 

We ask the questions that make so much sense. 

Why is it taking so long?

Why is there so much suffering?

Why can’t we just have Jesus back now and get things sorted?

Is God moving in a different direction that the one I always thought was the right one? Doesn’t it sometimes just feel like God is doing a new thing?


We find change hard, just like Peter. His example shows us that we too can get on the same page with God even though it might be a struggle sometimes. 

Cornelius shows us that even without the full picture God still hears us. God loves sinners and works to bring them close. To bring them to salvation in Jesus. 

And when we don’t understand the reasons things are happening.  

Give me all Your everything
Paint the sea a deeper green
And call it land
Spin me till I understand
You've got bigger hands than me
