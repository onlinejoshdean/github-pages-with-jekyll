# Josh has some ideas

## Here is the first idea

**1 Thess 5**

Paul is trying to move them away from worrying about the future and the details of what will and won’t happen. 

He shifts their gaze back to the important are of faith, hope, and love. Which is what we has been talking about since the beginning fo the letter 

> 1 Thessalonians 1:1 ESV - Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.


This is a great postive beginning. A wonderful way to start. 

> 1 Thessalonians 1:5–7 ESV - because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.


- Positive beginning
- Comforting them in their trials
- Reminding them of his conduct when he was with them

There we go.
